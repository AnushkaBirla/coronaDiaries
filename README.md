# Corona Diaries

Hi, and welcome to Corona Diaries! This is a space for you to share your experiences with covid-19. You can make a post with a title talking about how you've adapted, work-from-home setupsüè°, pet picturesüê∂, workout routines‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, etc! Make this space your own.

I made Corona Diaries as a project for an interview, more updates to come!

# Tech Stack:
This project was made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, with Node.js on the server side, and MongoDB as the database. 


# Going Forward
This is very much a work in progress! In the future I want to add the ability to make a user profile and authenticate, react and reply to posts, upload images, etc.
